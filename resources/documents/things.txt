The researchers catalogued precious artifacts including the Rosetta Stone tablet, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the Antikythera mechanism. Their tools ranged from electron microscopes and mass spectrometers to CT-scanners and X-ray machines. Among the examined items were Marie Curie's original radium-isolation apparatus, Edison's first light-bulb prototype, and Alexander Graham Bell's telephone handset. The collection included rare manuscripts like the Gutenberg Bible, Shakespeare's First Folio, and Darwin's On the Origin of Species handwritten notes. Modern equipment such as the IBM-5150 personal computer, Apple II, and UNIVAC mainframe were displayed alongside ancient tools: Mesopotamian clay tablets, Egyptian papyrus scrolls, and Viking long-sword artifacts. In the preservation lab, conservators used pH meters, digital scales, and electron microscopes to study the Hope Diamond, the Shroud of Turin, and fragments of the Liberty Bell.
