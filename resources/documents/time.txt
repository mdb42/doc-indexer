Historical research spanned from the Paleolithic Era through the Bronze Age and into the Industrial Revolution, with particular focus on the Renaissance period of the 15th-16th centuries. The longitudinal study, beginning on Monday, January 15th, 2024 at 9:30 AM EST, continued through the spring equinox until the summer solstice. Weekly seminars were held every Thursday afternoon at 2:15 PM, while monthly reviews took place on the first Monday of each month at dawn. The project timeline extended from the Mesozoic era through the Middle Ages, with carbon dating revealing artifacts from 50,000 BCE to 1500 CE. Research shifts rotated between morning sessions (6:00 AM - noon), afternoon blocks (1:00 PM - 6:00 PM), and night observations (8:00 PM - midnight), while seasonal variations were studied during autumn harvests and winter solstices. The decade-long project, scheduled until December 31st, 2035, included quarterly reports, biannual conferences, and annual symposiums held during leap years.
